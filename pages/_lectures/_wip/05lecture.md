    notes: "Content Warning: Harmful language to racialized peoples. When discussing ideas and topics from this reading, please do not use race or ethnicity as a noun, it is an adjective. And <a href='https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/eskimo'>do not use the word 'Esk*m*' to refer to Inuit Peoples</a>. As you read through this chapter, consider what are some of the unintended (or perhaps unanticipated) consequences of having this kind of harmful language in a book about race."
