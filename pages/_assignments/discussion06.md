Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as youâ€™re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

<!--
Since there were several options for the additional readings to complete, start by sharing:
- Which additional reading(s) did you complete?
- What were the main ideas of your reading(s)?
- What evidence did the author(s) use to support each main idea?
- What are the general/broader implications of each main idea? Why do they matter?

As you respond to your peers, expand on what they share by reflecting on:
- How do these ideas relate to the previous ideas/topics/frameworks we've considered in class?
- Why do these ideas matter within the context of computer science/technology?
- What does these ideas tell us about what we should keep in mind when designing/creating/evaluating the ethics of technologies?
