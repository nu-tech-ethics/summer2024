Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as you’re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

Take a few minutes to watch this [video about the rules of war, based on the Geneva Conventions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwpzzAefx9M).

- Consider the quote that says “In the future, wars may be fought with fully autonomous robots. But will such robots ever have the ability to distinguish between a military target and someone who must never be attacked?”
- Who gets to decide who is a military target and who is someone who must never be attacked? What kinds of impact(s) can technology have on these decisions?

Take another few minutes to watch this [video about how rules of war are interpreted and abided by (or not)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS7hMricwm0).
- Who gets to interpret and bend rules without consequence? Should there be consequences for them? What should they be?

Consider war as a whole.
- What does ‘efficiency’ mean in the context of war? For whom?
- Who and/or what benefits and who and/or what is harmed from war in the short term? In the long term?

Consider the accuracy of weaponry on a spectrum-- with one end being weapons that kill indiscriminately and the other end being weapons that kill ‘perfectly precise’. Similarly, consider this spectrum for automated weapons: automated weapons that kill indiscriminately and automated weapons that kill ‘perfectly precise’.
- Based on what we’ve learned so far, is it possible to have automated weapons that kill ‘perfectly precise’?
- Should automated weapons that kill ‘perfectly precise’ be a goal? Who would benefit and who would be harmed? -->
