## Presentation Guidelines
Record a short (no more than 10 min) presentation about your project. Think of your presentation as a project pitch to get feedback from your peers and instructors. If you worked in a group, y’all can record together or individually. 

**Briefly** present each of the five final components of your proposal and include a picture, screenshot, or description of your prototype.

## Feedback Guidelines
Comment on at least 3 different posts offering thoughtful feedback. When crafting your feedback, consider: 
- How does the project help us to see the possibilities and limits of tech on society in a new way?
- Is the problem something that can be addressed with technology? To what extent is the intervention helping to address some of the root causes of pervasive issues? 
- How is the project helping – either directly or indirectly – those who are most impacted by the underside of technology?
