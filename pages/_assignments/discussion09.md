Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as you’re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

<!--
Upload or record a video a short (no more than 8 min) presentation about your project. Think of your presentation as a project pitch to get feedback from your peers and instructors. If you worked in a group, y’all can record together or individually. Make sure to include the names of all group members in the video.
1. Describe the problem you're trying to address (Background)
1. Talk about your goals and approaches (Objectives & Methodology)
1. Include pictures, screenshots, screenshares and/or descriptions of your prototypes 
1. Describe any specific feedback that would be particularly useful from your peers

Individually, comment on at least three other posts (preferably ones that don’t have comments yet). Provide some words of encouragement and suggest an areas of improvement. Consider:
1. How does the project help us to see the possibilities and limits of tech on society in a new way?
1. To what extent is the problem something that can be addressed with technology? To what extent is the intervention helping to address some of the root causes of pervasive issues? 
1. How is the project helping – either directly or indirectly – those who are most impacted by the underside of technology?
