Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as youâ€™re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.
