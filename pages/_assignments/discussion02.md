Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as you’re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

As we consider the impacts technology has on people and the politics they (up)hold, let's explore one way to unpack the politics and people impacted by technology. Take a few minutes to [watch this Introduction to Algorithmic Ecology](https://youtu.be/CGzKqLWZfBw). After watching the video, take some time to reflect on the following:
- How does Winner’s framework compare and differ from algorithmic ecology? 
- What are the strengths and limitations of each?
- How is each useful?

Choose a technology you're fairly familiar with and do some research to identify its algorithmic ecology. In essence, figure out the answers to the following prompts:
- What is the technology representing or promoting?
- What ideologies are being upheld?
- What institutions are involved?
- How does the technology function?
- What community/ies are impacted and how?

Use your reflection and research to craft a 1-2 paragraph response describing:
- In what ways is your technology imbued with politics (a la Winner)?
- How is the technology's design and impact both: 
	- something that shapes and influences society and 
	- something that is shaped and influenced by society?
- Who gains from the creation and use of this technology and what do they gain?
- Who loses from the creation and use of this technology and what do they lose?

* If you're interested in reading more about the tool, you can [read the article it's introduced in](https://stoplapdspying.medium.com/the-algorithmic-ecology-an-abolitionist-tool-for-organizing-against-algorithms-14fcbd0e64d0). To learn more about the technology they're analyzing, I recommend watching 1) [NSF's introduction to PredPol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTIVIok4jT8) and 2) [watching predictive policing in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMAfBK7KITQ)followed by 3) a [short video on Black criminalization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQo-yYhExw0) and 4) a video explaining [the consequences and impacts PredPol has had in communities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZU_o87c08l4).
