Share your thoughts on the following:

_“The things we call ‘technologies’ are ways of building order in our world”_ (p. 127, last paragraph)

Think back to your response to IDJ #1 and how you characterized your relationship with technology. 
1. How did you define technology?
2. How does your definition of technology differ from this one?
3. What did your original definition include and exclude, and what are the implications of those inclusions/exclusions?
