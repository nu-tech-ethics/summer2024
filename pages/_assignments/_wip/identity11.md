As an engineer or manager, you’ll be someone in a position of power (and wealth) in the workforce. What are some ways you can help disrupt the exploitation of:
- Users? 
- Contractors? 
- Hourly laborers?
- Local communities?
- Global communities?

Thinking back to IDJ 9:
- What are you willing to do and risk for them? 
- How will you remind yourself to not get caught up and lost in the facade of it all?


**Remember to submit your entry on Canvas when done (as long as it’s before end of day)**
