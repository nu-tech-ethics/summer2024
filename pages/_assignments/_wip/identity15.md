Read through your entire journal and think about your experiences in the class.

Write a letter to your past self:
- What do you wish you knew on the first day of class? 
- What advice would you give to yourself?

If you are comfortable sharing this advice with a future student of the course, write “I consent to sharing this” at the top of your entry
