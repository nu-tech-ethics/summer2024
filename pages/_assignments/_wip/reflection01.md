## Purpose
For your [midterm]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/midterm), you'll be developing your own conceptual framework. You can think of a conceptual framework as a pair of sunglasses you're describing to help others 'see' the world through your lens. To further support your thinking through the readings and scaffold the work you'll be doing for your midterm, you'll be submitting brief reflections each week. The goal of these reflections is to help you start building your framework while the material is still fresh.

## Instructions
Identify **one quote** from the readings this week that resonated with you.
- How does the quote relate to a **core idea** from the reading?
- How does the idea from that quote resemble or differ from **your lived experiences and/or perspectives** on technology?
- How has **your identity** (or identities) impacted your relationship to these ideas?

### Format
Just like the midterm, your submission may be in written or video form. Please submit on Canvas
- 1-2 paragraphs of text OR 
- 2-3 minutes of video

## Feedback
You will receive feedback on your assignment within a few days of submission. Make sure to review the feedback as you craft your midterm.
