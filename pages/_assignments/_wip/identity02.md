Share your thoughts on the following:

1. What does ethics mean to you?

2. Reflect on what you’ve learned in class today, and revisit your response to part 1 (“What does ethics mean to you?”) (Consider how, if at all, your definition of ethics from the very beginning of class shaped how you responded to the scenarios from the second breakout activity?)

Remember: **Submit your *entry text* on Canvas.**
