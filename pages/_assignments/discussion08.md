Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as you’re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

One of the biggest critiques Race Critical Code Studies scholars have against current technologies is that they are more often than not built on the premise of techno-solutionism-- the idea that technology can solve all problems. Take a few minutes to [watch this brief lecture and Q&A from Morozov speaking on solutionism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhU0hRng-eE). Then, think about an incidence of harm caused by data science or algorithms that stood-out to you from the readings or that you’ve heard about outside of class. Take a few minutes to reflect: 
- What stood out to you about this particular example of harm?
- To what extent would more data or an improved model have prevented this kind of harm from happening?
- Are there aspects to it that more data or an improved model would not solve?
- What was the original problem trying to be solved? To what extent is a solution to this problem achievable through only technological means?
- To what extent is this technology an example of techno-solutionism? How differently would the technology have been designed if more attention was paid to the systems involved in root of the problem?

Take a few minutes to watch this video where Noble speaks on 'Freedom from Fear' Links to an external site.. Consider this week's readings in conversation with what we've read and discussed regarding unintended (unanticipated) consequences:
- How differently would this technology have been designed if consequences had been better anticipated?

In responding to your peers, consider:
- What other ways can we address harm caused by algorithms and data science?
- What other ways should we thinking about solving problems beyond creating/using technology?
