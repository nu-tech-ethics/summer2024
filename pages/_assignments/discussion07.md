Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as you’re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

Race critical code studies bridges the readings we've discussed so far, bringing together STS and constructs of race to understand at technology and its impacts. One of the biggest arguments of race critical code studies is that technology is both impacted by us and impacting us. While "Technological Determinism" argues that our tools shape us and "Social Construction of Technology" argues that we shape our tools, Benjamin posits a hybrid of both wherein we shape our tools AND our tools also shape us. As such, technology is neither good nor bad but it's also not neutral. Keep these ideas in mind as you complete your responses this week and refer to them in your initial post and the responses to your peers.

Revisit Benjamin's descriptions of tech at various paces:
- Move fast and break things (p. 7)
- Move fast, break people, and call it progress (p. 7)
- Move slower and protect people (p. 8)
- Move slower and empower people (p. 9)

Look up FN Meka and/or Lil Miquela. 
- Would you consider this laudable or exploitative, opportunistic or oppressive?*
- Who ultimately profits from the proliferation ‘post-racial’ AI creations?* 
- Which pace were these technologies developed at?
- How different would they be at slower paces?

*Questions adapted from Benjamin pg. 16
