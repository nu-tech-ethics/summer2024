Please respond to this week's discussion prompt on Canvas. Remember that these online discussions are a form of collaborative sense-making to understand, critique, and interrogate this week's readings. Please make your **initial post by Wednesday** so your peers have time to read and respond to your post. You should engage with and **respond to your peers by Friday**.

We encourage you to engage with as many peers as you’re able to, and challenge you to do so deeply and meaningfully. The goal is to have a conversation, not to meet a requirement. Your replies to each other should build on each other's ideas and draw from the readings and your experiences, and should be done in a respectful tone even if you disagree.

<!-- As we think about whether something is ethical or not, we may consider who is impacted, how many people are impacted, and/or the extent of the impact, among other considerations. Within the philosophy discipline, it is broadly accepted that there are 5-6 approaches or lenses to ethics:
- **The Utilitarian Approach** which broadly considers:
	- Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?
	- What benefits and what harms will each course of action produce, and which alternative will lead to the best overall consequences?
- **The Rights Approach** which broadly considers:
	- Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?
	- What moral rights do the affected parties have, and which course of action best respects those rights?
- **The Common Good Approach** which broadly considers:
	- Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?
	- Which course of action advances the common good?
- **The Virtue Approach** which broadly considers:
	- Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?
	- What kind of person should I be? What will promote the development of character within myself and my community?
	- Which course of action develops moral virtues?
- **The Fairness or Justice Approach** which broadly considers:
	- Which option treats people equally or proportionately?
	- Which course of action treats everyone the same, except where there is a morally justifiable reason not to, and does not show favoritism or discrimination?
- **The Care Ethics Approach** which broadly considers:
	- How can social, economic, and political institutions and practices be organized to contribute to and support caring relationships? 
	- How can care work, the labor required to take care of others— including the environment and non-human animals— be fairly distributed and rewarded in society?

For this week's dicussion, we'll be putting in conversation these ethical approaches and the Williams et. al reading. Choose one of the five scenarios described in the Williams et. al reading:
1. Scenario 1 https://www.modernhealthcare.com/operations/
Hospitals are using technology that will suggest to doctors which medical tests individuals should be given for diagnosis while also minimizing patient costs and maximizing accuracy of diagnosis.
1. Scenario 2 https://www.centerforpublicrep.org/covid-19-medical-rationing/
Hospitals are using predictive algorithms to optimize their intensive care rationing protocols. The intent is to maximize lives saved by offering intensive care, such as ventilators, only to those patients most likely to survive.
1. Scenario 3 https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/do-not-resuscitate-orders-caused-panic-uk-truth
Primary care physicians are using a predictive algorithm to determine patient risk of contracting and succumbing to COVID-19. Based on patient likelihood of death, providers are mailing out recommendations for patients to sign DNR (do not resuscitate) orders.
1. Scenario 4 https://www.facs.org/covid-19/clinical-guidance/triage
A predictive algorithm has been developed to help hospitals and clinics determine which out-patient procedures can be delayed based on projections of the likelihood that patients will require emergency services if the procedure is not performed on schedule.
1. Scenario 5 https://www.dropbox.com/s/h3hjktdvz3qxes3/2020.04
A licensed Medicare provider has developed a system that allows hospitals to divert the personal medical equipment of local Medicare recipients to hospital ICUs. Under this system, the personal Medicare-provided ventilator of a person with a chronic respiratory condition can be repossessed and delivered to hospital staff.

Use [A Framework for Ethical Decision Making](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/a-framework-for-ethical-decision-making/) to evaluate the potential impacts of the proposed system. Make sure to consider both the patient individually and society as a whole. In your initial post describe:
- What was your scenario?
- What questions and/or concerns came up?
- Would you consider the technology to be overall good, bad, or neither?
- Would you support the technology being used on yourself and/or your loved ones?

In the responses to your peers consider:
- What potential benefits have been missed in the conversation so far?
- What potential harms have been missed in the conversation so far?
- What are some of the offerings and limitations of the framework we used?
