## Instructions
Develop a conceptual framework that draws on the readings as well as your identity to articulate your unique perspective on a **specific technology**. That is, 
1. you will choose **a single technology** that you would like to analyze, 
2. you will develop a framework based on theoretical arguments from **at least 3 of the readings** covered thus far _and_ **your own personal identity and experience** in the world, 
3. you will **apply your framework** to analyze your chosen technology. 

### Format
Your analysis may be in **written or video form** and must include citations of any quotes or ideas used as well as a bibliography. Your bibliography does not count towards the page/time requirement/limit. Please submit on Canvas:
- A 6-7 page double spaced paper using 12-point Times New Roman font OR
- A 15-20 minute video presentation using slides, Prezi, Canva, or another visual aid

### Citations
Follow [APA guidelines](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa6_style/index.html) for formatting and references:
- Include an [APA style bibliography](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html) at end of writeup or as slide at end of video
- **Written submissions** should use any combination of:
  - [In-text citations](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html) 
  - Hyperlinks of names ([like this example](https://points.datasociety.net/how-to-cite-like-a-badass-tech-feminist-scholar-of-color-ebc839a3619c))
- **Video submissions** should use any combination of:
  - Verbal or textual cues (i.e., “According to Winner in ‘Do Artifacts have Politics…” while speaking)
  - [In-text citations](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/in_text_citations_the_basics.html) when using slides
  - Video annotations ([like this example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3rS7I6Xyz8))

## Tips and Examples

Ultimately, your conceptual framework should be useful, and productive. You will draw upon it to conduct a **sociopolitical analysis of your chosen technology**. For example, your analysis could be designed to shed light on questions such as: 
- What values do this technology reflect, embrace, reject, or encourage? 
- Who is affected by its design? How was its design affected by society? 
- Who reaps the benefits, and who suffers the costs of its creation and use? 

Examples:
- [E-Scooters in Chicago: A Cautionary Tale e-scooters](https://tree-in-education.github.io/BreakPointNU/index.html)
  - "This paper seeks to understand the values and attitudes that have shaped the implementation of e-scooter technology in Chicago, and their subsequent impact on society. In the process, we will also examine the interplay of public policy and technological advancement, and the politics embedded in society’s interaction with technology."
- [Blue Emergency Lights: An Investment in White Supremacist Surveillance on College Campuses](https://tree-in-education.github.io/BreakPointNU/index.html)
  - "I maintain there is an alternative intention; blue emergency lights are a measure of surveillance to increase the perceived safety of students through the exile, policing, and surveillance of Black and brown people."

|  | Full <br> (Grade: A-B) | Partial <br>  (Grade: B-C) | Needs work <br> (Grade: C or lower) |  |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Structure, clarity, citations** | Easy to follow line of analysis through the paper. Well Organized. APA Formatting. Citations. | Needs additional clarity on line of analysis through the paper. Semi Organized. APA Formatting. Citations. | Minimal to no line of analysis through the paper. Not Organized. Lacks APA Formatting. Lacks citations. |  |
| **Conceptual Framework** | Thoughtful integration of multiple theoretical perspectives drawing on at least 3 constructs from readings covered so far; clear articulation of how personal experience/identity informs conceptual framework; makes visible how conceptual framework will be useful for the specific purposes of the ethical analysis centered in paper. | Includes references to theoretical constructs and/or personal experience/identity, but integration is unclear or incoherent; link to analysis is partial or incomplete. | Does not integrate multiple theoretical perspectives using readings; fails to incorporate personal experience/identity in framework; unclear how framework is linked to analysis. |  |
| **Analysis** | Draws clear connections to conceptual framework with references to readings as appropriate. Considers multiple perspectives and includes analysis which addresses implications of technology and how societal conditions shaped design and intent of technology. | Makes undertheorized connections to conceptual framework with references to readings as appropriate. Considers one perspective and lacks analysis that addresses both implications of technology and how societal conditions shaped design and intent of technology. | No clear connections to conceptual framework. Does not consider perspectives or include analysis that addresses implications of technology and how societal conditions shaped design and intent of technology. |  |
