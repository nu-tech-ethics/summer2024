## Purpose
For your [midterm]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/midterm), you'll be developing your own conceptual framework. You can think of a conceptual framework as a pair of sunglasses you're describing to help others 'see' the world through your lens. To further support your thinking through the readings and scaffold the work you'll be doing for your midterm, you'll be submitting brief reflections each week. The goal of these reflections is to help you start building your framework while the material is still fresh.

## Instructions
1. Review the [midterm rubric]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/midterm#ethics_rubric)
1. Outline what you would like your conceptual framework to do
	- What questions do you want it to ask?
	- What perspectives do you want it to help readers consider?
	- What do you want readers (to be able) to do with your conceptual framework?
	- What do you want readers to take away from using your conceptual framework?
1. Identify how your experiences and/or identities have contributed to the ideas in your outline
1. Identify which readings from the course so far have contributed to the ideas in your outline
1. Identify 1-2 quotes from each reading that could support the ideas in your conceptual framework

### Format
Just like the midterm, your submission may be in written or video form. Please submit on Canvas
- 3-4 paragraphs of text OR 
- 3-5 minutes of video

## Feedback
You will receive feedback on your assignment within a few days of submission. Make sure to review the feedback as you craft your midterm.
