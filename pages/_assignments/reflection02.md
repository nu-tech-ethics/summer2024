## Purpose
For your [midterm]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/midterm), you'll be developing your own conceptual framework. You can think of a conceptual framework as a pair of sunglasses you're describing to help others 'see' the world through your lens. To further support your thinking through the readings and scaffold the work you'll be doing for your midterm, you'll be submitting brief reflections each week. The goal of these reflections is to help you start building your framework while the material is still fresh.

## Instructions
1. Review the [example midterms and video]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/midterm#ethics_tips-and-examples)
1. Identify **one reading** from the readings this week that resonated with you
1. Identify that reading's **core argument**
	- How has **your identity** (or identities) impacted your relationship to this argument?
	- How does that argument resemble or differ from **your lived experiences and/or perspectives** on technology?
1. Choose *any one* technology you're familiar with
	- What perspectives can your chosen reading's core idea offer in relation to this technology? In other words, what might the author of your chosen reading have to say about your chosen technology?

### Format
Just like the midterm, your submission may be in written or video form. Please submit on Canvas
- 2-3 paragraphs of text OR 
- 3-5 minutes of video

## Feedback
You will receive feedback on your assignment within a few days of submission. Make sure to review the feedback as you craft your midterm.
