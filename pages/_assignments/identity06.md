1. Take some time to reflect on the following questions:
	- What do you know about race in the US? 
	- What about outside the US?
	- What race do people perceive you as and how do you know that?
	- Is the race you're perceived as the race you identify as? 
	- How do you choose what race to identify as?
1. Then, review [this historical timeline of race as categorized by the U.S. Census](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/PH_15.06.11_MultiRacial-Timeline.pdf).
1. Revisit your answers to the questions above and reflect on the Census timeline:
	- What/Who are the constants?
	- Who appeared? Who disappeared? 
	- What does it mean for a race to change or disappear? 
	- How does this reflect the (hi)story of America?
	- How would you and/or your ancestors have been identified by census takers? How would you identify now?
1. Consider how much our field relies on data collection and visualization:
	- How would/do races get collapsed for data reporting? 
	- Who makes those decisions? 
	- Who does it impact? 
	- What does it mean to lump or group multiple groups as one?
	- Why is it important to identify how tools and data represent reality?
