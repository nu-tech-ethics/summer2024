Think about your identities, your access to power and privilege, and your relationship with technology
- How do the technologies you use reflect, embrace, reject, or encourage these sources of power and privilege (i.e., your identities)?
- How does your proximity to the center of power and privilege impact how you interact with or think about these technologies?

Map out your cultural wealth 
- Feel free to be as artistic as you’d like– use your computer, pen and paper, colors, whatever you have available!
- How can you use your community cultural wealth to disrupt systems of harm?
