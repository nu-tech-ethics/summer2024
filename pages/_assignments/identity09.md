Think about the kinds of values do you want to uphold as a technologist:
- How will you honor those values in practice?
- What are you willing to do to uphold said values? 
- What are you willing to give up for them?
- How will you keep yourself and your values grounded in an industry that “move[s] fast and break[s] things [and people]”?
