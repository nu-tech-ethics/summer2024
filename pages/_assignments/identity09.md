Consider how the dreams/approaches/alternative futures we’ve learned about this week compare and contrast to solutionist approaches we’ve learned about. Reflect on your learnings throughout the term and your final project. Think about the kinds of values do you want to uphold as a technologist. Consider:
- How do you want to contribute to the process of:
	- dreaming and reimagining
	- healing, liberation, and/or justice	
	- aligning with your values
- How does your final project reflect these (or not)?
