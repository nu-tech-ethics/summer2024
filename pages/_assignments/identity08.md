“But the presumed blandness of White American culture is a crucial part of our national narrative. 
Scholars describe the power of this plainness as the **invisible ‘center’** against which everything else is 
compared and as the ‘norm’ against which everyone else is measured. Upon further reflection, what appears to be an 
absence in terms of being ‘cultureless’ works more like a superpower. **Invisibility, with regard to Whiteness, offers 
immunity**. To be unmarked by race allows you to reap the benefits but escape responsibility for your role in an unjust 
system.” (p. 2)

Revisit IDJ #4 and IDJ #6 in conversation with the quote above and Benjamin’s discussion of names.
- What has/have your name(s) afforded you?
- Have you benefited from other forms of invisibility and immunity you didn’t consider in previous entries?
