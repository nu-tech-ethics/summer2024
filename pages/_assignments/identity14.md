Consider today’s reading and conversations in relation to your final project: 
- How would you want to contribute to the process of dreaming for Shanel (and the world’s future children)?
- How would you want to contribute to the process of liberation?
- How would you want to contribute to the process of healing?

**If you haven’t started your proposal yet**: jot down some bullet points for your proposal document with these questions in mind. 
**If you’ve already started your proposal**: continue expanding on your ideas with these questions in mind. 


**Remember to submit your entry on Canvas when done (as long as it’s before end of day)**
